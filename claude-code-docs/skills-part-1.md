# Extend Claude with skills

> Create, manage, and share skills to extend Claude's capabilities in Claude Code. Includes custom commands and bundled skills.

Skills extend what Claude can do. Create a `SKILL.md` file with instructions, and Claude adds it to its toolkit. Claude uses skills when relevant, or you can invoke one directly with `/skill-name`.

<Note>
  For built-in commands like `/help` and `/compact`, see the [built-in commands reference](/en/commands).

  **Custom commands have been merged into skills.** A file at `.claude/commands/deploy.md` and a skill at `.claude/skills/deploy/SKILL.md` both create `/deploy` and work the same way. Your existing `.claude/commands/` files keep working. Skills add optional features: a directory for supporting files, frontmatter to [control whether you or Claude invokes them](#control-who-invokes-a-skill), and the ability for Claude to load them automatically when relevant.
</Note>

Claude Code skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard, which works across multiple AI tools. Claude Code extends the standard with additional features like [invocation control](#control-who-invokes-a-skill), [subagent execution](#run-skills-in-a-subagent), and [dynamic context injection](#inject-dynamic-context).

## Bundled skills

Bundled skills ship with Claude Code and are available in every session. Unlike [built-in commands](/en/commands), which execute fixed logic directly, bundled skills are prompt-based: they give Claude a detailed playbook and let it orchestrate the work using its tools. This means bundled skills can spawn parallel agents, read files, and adapt to your codebase.

You invoke bundled skills the same way as any other skill: type `/` followed by the skill name. In the table below, `<arg>` indicates a required argument and `[arg]` indicates an optional one.

| Skill                       | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| :-------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/batch <instruction>`      | Orchestrate large-scale changes across a codebase in parallel. Researches the codebase, decomposes the work into 5 to 30 independent units, and presents a plan. Once approved, spawns one background agent per unit in an isolated [git worktree](/en/common-workflows#run-parallel-claude-code-sessions-with-git-worktrees). Each agent implements its unit, runs tests, and opens a pull request. Requires a git repository. Example: `/batch migrate src/ from Solid to React` |
| `/claude-api`               | Load Claude API reference material for your project's language (Python, TypeScript, Java, Go, Ruby, C#, PHP, or cURL) and Agent SDK reference for Python and TypeScript. Covers tool use, streaming, batches, structured outputs, and common pitfalls. Also activates automatically when your code imports `anthropic`, `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, or `claude_agent_sdk`                                                                                                                 |
| `/debug [description]`      | Enable debug logging for the current session and troubleshoot issues by reading the session debug log. Debug logging is off by default unless you started with `claude --debug`, so running `/debug` mid-session starts capturing logs from that point forward. Optionally describe the issue to focus the analysis                                                                                                                                                                |
| `/loop [interval] <prompt>` | Run a prompt repeatedly on an interval while the session stays open. Useful for polling a deployment, babysitting a PR, or periodically re-running another skill. Example: `/loop 5m check if the deploy finished`. See [Run prompts on a schedule](/en/scheduled-tasks)                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `/simplify [focus]`         | Review your recently changed files for code reuse, quality, and efficiency issues, then fix them. Spawns three review agents in parallel, aggregates their findings, and applies fixes. Pass text to focus on specific concerns: `/simplify focus on memory efficiency`                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Getting started

### Create your first skill

This example creates a skill that teaches Claude to explain code using visual diagrams and analogies. Since it uses default frontmatter, Claude can load it automatically when you ask how something works, or you can invoke it directly with `/explain-code`.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the skill directory">
    Create a directory for the skill in your personal skills folder. Personal skills are available across all your projects.

    ```bash  theme={null}
    mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/explain-code
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Write SKILL.md">
    Every skill needs a `SKILL.md` file with two parts: YAML frontmatter (between `---` markers) that tells Claude when to use the skill, and markdown content with instructions Claude follows when the skill is invoked. The `name` field becomes the `/slash-command`, and the `description` helps Claude decide when to load it automatically.

    Create `~/.claude/skills/explain-code/SKILL.md`:

    ```yaml  theme={null}
    ---
    name: explain-code
    description: Explains code with visual diagrams and analogies. Use when explaining how code works, teaching about a codebase, or when the user asks "how does this work?"
    ---

    When explaining code, always include:

    1. **Start with an analogy**: Compare the code to something from everyday life
    2. **Draw a diagram**: Use ASCII art to show the flow, structure, or relationships
    3. **Walk through the code**: Explain step-by-step what happens
    4. **Highlight a gotcha**: What's a common mistake or misconception?

    Keep explanations conversational. For complex concepts, use multiple analogies.
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the skill">
    You can test it two ways:

    **Let Claude invoke it automatically** by asking something that matches the description:

    ```text  theme={null}
    How does this code work?
    ```

    **Or invoke it directly** with the skill name:

    ```text  theme={null}
    /explain-code src/auth/login.ts
    ```

    Either way, Claude should include an analogy and ASCII diagram in its explanation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Where skills live

Where you store a skill determines who can use it:

| Location   | Path                                                | Applies to                     |
| :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| Enterprise | See [managed settings](/en/settings#settings-files) | All users in your organization |
| Personal   | `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`            | All your projects              |
| Project    | `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`              | This project only              |
| Plugin     | `<plugin>/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`             | Where plugin is enabled        |

When skills share the same name across levels, higher-priority locations win: enterprise > personal > project. Plugin skills use a `plugin-name:skill-name` namespace, so they cannot conflict with other levels. If you have files in `.claude/commands/`, those work the same way, but if a skill and a command share the same name, the skill takes precedence.

#### Automatic discovery from nested directories

When you work with files in subdirectories, Claude Code automatically discovers skills from nested `.claude/skills/` directories. For example, if you're editing a file in `packages/frontend/`, Claude Code also looks for skills in `packages/frontend/.claude/skills/`. This supports monorepo setups where packages have their own skills.

Each skill is a directory with `SKILL.md` as the entrypoint:

```text  theme={null}
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md           # Main instructions (required)
├── template.md        # Template for Claude to fill in
├── examples/
│   └── sample.md      # Example output showing expected format
└── scripts/
    └── validate.sh    # Script Claude can execute
```

The `SKILL.md` contains the main instructions and is required. Other files are optional and let you build more powerful skills: templates for Claude to fill in, example outputs showing the expected format, scripts Claude can execute, or detailed reference documentation. Reference these files from your `SKILL.md` so Claude knows what they contain and when to load them. See [Add supporting files](#add-supporting-files) for more details.

<Note>
  Files in `.claude/commands/` still work and support the same [frontmatter](#frontmatter-reference). Skills are recommended since they support additional features like supporting files.
</Note>

#### Skills from additional directories

The `--add-dir` flag [grants file access](/en/permissions#additional-directories-grant-file-access-not-configuration) rather than configuration discovery, but skills are an exception: `.claude/skills/` within an added directory is loaded automatically and picked up by live change detection, so you can edit those skills during a session without restarting.

Other `.claude/` configuration such as subagents, commands, and output styles is not loaded from additional directories. See the [exceptions table](/en/permissions#additional-directories-grant-file-access-not-configuration) for the complete list of what is and isn't loaded, and the recommended ways to share configuration across projects.

<Note>
  CLAUDE.md files from `--add-dir` directories are not loaded by default. To load them, set `CLAUDE_CODE_ADDITIONAL_DIRECTORIES_CLAUDE_MD=1`. See [Load from additional directories](/en/memory#load-from-additional-directories).
</Note>

## Configure skills

Skills are configured through YAML frontmatter at the top of `SKILL.md` and the markdown content that follows.

### Types of skill content

Skill files can contain any instructions, but thinking about how you want to invoke them helps guide what to include:

**Reference content** adds knowledge Claude applies to your current work. Conventions, patterns, style guides, domain knowledge. This content runs inline so Claude can use it alongside your conversation context.

```yaml  theme={null}
---
name: api-conventions
description: API design patterns for this codebase
---

When writing API endpoints:
- Use RESTful naming conventions
- Return consistent error formats
- Include request validation
```

**Task content** gives Claude step-by-step instructions for a specific action, like deployments, commits, or code generation. These are often actions you want to invoke directly with `/skill-name` rather than letting Claude decide when to run them. Add `disable-model-invocation: true` to prevent Claude from triggering it automatically.

```yaml  theme={null}
---
name: deploy
description: Deploy the application to production
context: fork
disable-model-invocation: true
---

Deploy the application:
1. Run the test suite
2. Build the application
3. Push to the deployment target
```

Your `SKILL.md` can contain anything, but thinking through how you want the skill invoked (by you, by Claude, or both) and where you want it to run (inline or in a subagent) helps guide what to include. For complex skills, you can also [add supporting files](#add-supporting-files) to keep the main skill focused.

### Frontmatter reference

Beyond the markdown content, you can configure skill behavior using YAML frontmatter fields between `---` markers at the top of your `SKILL.md` file:

```yaml  theme={null}
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does
disable-model-invocation: true
allowed-tools: Read Grep
---

Your skill instructions here...
```

All fields are optional. Only `description` is recommended so Claude knows when to use the skill.

| Field                      | Required    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :------------------------- | :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`                     | No          | Display name for the skill. If omitted, uses the directory name. Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only (max 64 characters).                                                                                                                                                        |
| `description`              | Recommended | What the skill does and when to use it. Claude uses this to decide when to apply the skill. If omitted, uses the first paragraph of markdown content. Front-load the key use case: descriptions longer than 250 characters are truncated in the skill listing to reduce context usage.    |
| `argument-hint`            | No          | Hint shown during autocomplete to indicate expected arguments. Example: `[issue-number]` or `[filename] [format]`.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `disable-model-invocation` | No          | Set to `true` to prevent Claude from automatically loading this skill. Use for workflows you want to trigger manually with `/name`. Default: `false`.                                                                                                                                     |
| `user-invocable`           | No          | Set to `false` to hide from the `/` menu. Use for background knowledge users shouldn't invoke directly. Default: `true`.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `allowed-tools`            | No          | Tools Claude can use without asking permission when this skill is active. Accepts a space-separated string or a YAML list.                                                                                                                                                                |
| `model`                    | No          | Model to use when this skill is active.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `effort`                   | No          | [Effort level](/en/model-config#adjust-effort-level) when this skill is active. Overrides the session effort level. Default: inherits from session. Options: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `max` (Opus 4.6 only).                                                                              |
| `context`                  | No          | Set to `fork` to run in a forked subagent context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `agent`                    | No          | Which subagent type to use when `context: fork` is set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `hooks`                    | No          | Hooks scoped to this skill's lifecycle. See [Hooks in skills and agents](/en/hooks#hooks-in-skills-and-agents) for configuration format.                                                                                                                                                  |
| `paths`                    | No          | Glob patterns that limit when this skill is activated. Accepts a comma-separated string or a YAML list. When set, Claude loads the skill automatically only when working with files matching the patterns. Uses the same format as [path-specific rules](/en/memory#path-specific-rules). |
| `shell`                    | No          | Shell to use for `` !`command` `` blocks in this skill. Accepts `bash` (default) or `powershell`. Setting `powershell` runs inline shell commands via PowerShell on Windows. Requires `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL=1`.                                                                |

#### Available string substitutions

Skills support string substitution for dynamic values in the skill content:

| Variable               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :--------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$ARGUMENTS`           | All arguments passed when invoking the skill. If `$ARGUMENTS` is not present in the content, arguments are appended as `ARGUMENTS: <value>`.                                                                                                                                             |
| `$ARGUMENTS[N]`        | Access a specific argument by 0-based index, such as `$ARGUMENTS[0]` for the first argument.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `$N`                   | Shorthand for `$ARGUMENTS[N]`, such as `$0` for the first argument or `$1` for the second.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}` | The current session ID. Useful for logging, creating session-specific files, or correlating skill output with sessions.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`  | The directory containing the skill's `SKILL.md` file. For plugin skills, this is the skill's subdirectory within the plugin, not the plugin root. Use this in bash injection commands to reference scripts or files bundled with the skill, regardless of the current working directory. |

**Example using substitutions:**

```yaml  theme={null}
---
name: session-logger
description: Log activity for this session
---

Log the following to logs/${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}.log:

$ARGUMENTS
```

### Add supporting files

Skills can include multiple files in their directory. This keeps `SKILL.md` focused on the essentials while letting Claude access detailed reference material only when needed. Large reference docs, API specifications, or example collections don't need to load into context every time the skill runs.

```text  theme={null}
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md (required - overview and navigation)
├── reference.md (detailed API docs - loaded when needed)
├── examples.md (usage examples - loaded when needed)
└── scripts/
    └── helper.py (utility script - executed, not loaded)
```

Reference supporting files from `SKILL.md` so Claude knows what each file contains and when to load it:

```markdown  theme={null}
## Additional resources

- For complete API details, see [reference.md](reference.md)
- For usage examples, see [examples.md](examples.md)
```

<Tip>Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines. Move detailed reference material to separate files.</Tip>

### Control who invokes a skill

By default, both you and Claude can invoke any skill. You can type `/skill-name` to invoke it directly, and Claude can load it automatically when relevant to your conversation. Two frontmatter fields let you restrict this:

* **`disable-model-invocation: true`**: Only you can invoke the skill. Use this for workflows with side effects or that you want to control timing, like `/commit`, `/deploy`, or `/send-slack-message`. You don't want Claude deciding to deploy because your code looks ready.

* **`user-invocable: false`**: Only Claude can invoke the skill. Use this for background knowledge that isn't actionable as a command. A `legacy-system-context` skill explains how an old system works. Claude should know this when relevant, but `/legacy-system-context` isn't a meaningful action for users to take.

This example creates a deploy skill that only you can trigger. The `disable-model-invocation: true` field prevents Claude from running it automatically:

```yaml  theme={null}
---
name: deploy
description: Deploy the application to production
disable-model-invocation: true
---

Deploy $ARGUMENTS to production:

1. Run the test suite
2. Build the application
3. Push to the deployment target
4. Verify the deployment succeeded
```

Here's how the two fields affect invocation and context loading:

| Frontmatter                      | You can invoke | Claude can invoke | When loaded into context                                     |
| :------------------------------- | :------------- | :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| (default)                        | Yes            | Yes               | Description always in context, full skill loads when invoked |
| `disable-model-invocation: true` | Yes            | No                | Description not in context, full skill loads when you invoke |
| `user-invocable: false`          | No             | Yes               | Description always in context, full skill loads when invoked |

<Note>
  In a regular session, skill descriptions are loaded into context so Claude knows what's available, but full skill content only loads when invoked. [Subagents with preloaded skills](/en/sub-agents#preload-skills-into-subagents) work differently: the full skill content is injected at startup.
</Note>

### Restrict tool access

Use the `allowed-tools` field to limit which tools Claude can use when a skill is active. This skill creates a read-only mode where Claude can explore files but not modify them:

```yaml  theme={null}
---
name: safe-reader
description: Read files without making changes
allowed-tools: Read Grep Glob
---
```

### Pass arguments to skills

Both you and Claude can pass arguments when invoking a skill. Arguments are available via the `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder.

This skill fixes a GitHub issue by number. The `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder gets replaced with whatever follows the skill name:

```yaml  theme={null}
---
name: fix-issue
description: Fix a GitHub issue
disable-model-invocation: true
---

Fix GitHub issue $ARGUMENTS following our coding standards.

1. Read the issue description
2. Understand the requirements
3. Implement the fix
4. Write tests
5. Create a commit
```

When you run `/fix-issue 123`, Claude receives "Fix GitHub issue 123 following our coding standards..."

If you invoke a skill with arguments but the skill doesn't include `$ARGUMENTS`, Claude Code appends `ARGUMENTS: <your input>` to the end of the skill content so Claude still sees what you typed.

To access individual arguments by position, use `$ARGUMENTS[N]` or the shorter `$N`:

```yaml  theme={null}
---
name: migrate-component
description: Migrate a component from one framework to another
---

Migrate the $ARGUMENTS[0] component from $ARGUMENTS[1] to $ARGUMENTS[2].
Preserve all existing behavior and tests.
```

Running `/migrate-component SearchBar React Vue` replaces `$ARGUMENTS[0]` with `SearchBar`, `$ARGUMENTS[1]` with `React`, and `$ARGUMENTS[2]` with `Vue`. The same skill using the `$N` shorthand:

```yaml  theme={null}
---
name: migrate-component
description: Migrate a component from one framework to another
---

Migrate the $0 component from $1 to $2.
Preserve all existing behavior and tests.
```
